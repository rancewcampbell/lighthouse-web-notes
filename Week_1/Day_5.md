## Debugging

Before you call yourself stuck, ask yourself the following questions:

Have I...

...pseudo-coded the solution?

...googled the error message I am getting?

...actually READ the error message?

...double-checked my syntax?

...linted my code?

...pair programmed or gotten a peer to code review?

...rubber-ducked the problem?

If the answer to all of these questions is yes, then you have done your due diligence and should be calling a mentor over.

## Recursion

* All recursive functions must have a base case and a recursive case

* Every recursive call should break the problem down to smaller and smaller chunks

* base case is when the problem can be solved without further recursion
