## Trees

* The start of the tree is referred to as the 'root'

* The ends of the tree are referred to as 'leaves'

* Each piece of data on the tree is a 'node'

* Every node has a 'parent' except the root

* Every node has a child except a 'leaf' which has no children

* Nodes with the same parent are referred to as 'siblings'
