# Day 1

## Lecture Notes

* A webserver is an application that serves hosted files.

* app.use() is a higher order function. Call middleware inside of app.use().

* rendering templates are usually placed in a `views` template.

## Feedback for Town Hall:

* Course is going really well for me, I have found the workload to be extensive but not overbearing mostly

* Lecture format is well done, especially appreciate coding breakouts during lectures as they keep it interactive

* Mentors have been mostly helpful, definitely have my favorites as I'm sure everyone else does.

* More additional resources for reading/learning in spare time?

[] Keep track of topics that I want to look into more.
