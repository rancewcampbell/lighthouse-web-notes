# Day 1 Notes

## Lecture Notes 

* Always put imports at the top of the file so other developers know what is required.

* .gitignore node modules. They stay local

* When making a test file it is good to use .test.js

* Good practice to use `run` command when running npm commands.

* Never mix test code with production code. 

## Breakout session:

### Test tips:
* Read the question thoroughly
* What data do I have access to? This is the input for the function.
* What is the expected response/what am I supposed to do with the data i.e. return value.
* Don't spend too long on a single question.
* Use pseudo code to plan out the logic (comments). Break it down 
* Rubber duck debugging
* Write the minimum amount of code to make tests pass
* Make the tests pass, then fix linting errors
* Google! Google! Google!
* Submit frequently 
* The tests work
